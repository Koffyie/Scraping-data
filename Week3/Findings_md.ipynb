        "## Dataset\n",
        "I used a public dataset of the **Highest Grossing Music Tours by Women**, which I deliberately chose because it was messy (‚Äúdirty data‚Äù) and required cleaning. This gave me hands-on practice with real-world data issues.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Cleaning\n",
        "- Removed unnecessary characters and formatting issues.  \n",
        "- Handled duplicate artists (some appeared multiple times).  \n",
        "- Converted columns like *Gross* and *Shows* into proper numeric formats.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Explorations & Visualizations\n",
        "- **Top Artists by Gross Revenue** ‚Äì Taylor Swift emerged as the queen üëë (forever a Swiftie!).  \n",
        "- **Artists with the Highest Number of Shows** ‚Äì revealed consistency vs. impact strategies.  \n",
        "- **Touring Years Analysis** ‚Äì trends across decades.  \n",
        "- **Correlation Insights** ‚Äì e.g., *Actual Gross* and *Adjusted Gross* were highly correlated, while *Number of Shows* had a **negative correlation** with *Average Gross*. This suggests that fewer shows often bring in higher per-show earnings.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Reflections\n",
        "Data cleaning really reminded me why it‚Äôs called the most time-consuming part of Data Science! But after cleaning, the dataset revealed fun and meaningful patterns.  \n",
